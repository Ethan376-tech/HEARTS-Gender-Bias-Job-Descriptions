    "## Dataset Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Name:** U.S. Technology Jobs on Dice.com\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/us-technology-jobs-on-dicecom/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Size:** 21,978 job descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**SDG Alignment:** This research aligns with **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)** and **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)**, contributing to the  Sustainable Development Goals through the detection and mitigation of gender bias in employment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Appropriateness and Ethical Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Appropriateness for Research Objective:**\n",
    "This dataset is **appropriate** for gender bias detection research in job descriptions for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-World Relevance**: The dataset contains actual job postings from Dice.com, a major technology job board, providing **authentic examples** of how companies communicate job opportunities in the technology sector—an industry with well-documented gender disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Representative Sample**: With 21,978 job descriptions, the dataset provides a **substantial and representative sample** of technology job postings, enabling robust statistical analysis and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Public Domain Data**: The job descriptions are **publicly available** information posted on a public job board, making them appropriate for research use without privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Direct Application**: Technology sector job descriptions are particularly relevant for gender bias research, as this field has historically shown significant gender imbalances, making the detection and mitigation of biased language a critical concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical Sourcing and Data Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Publicly Available Data**: All job descriptions were obtained from publicly accessible job postings on Dice.com, ensuring **ethical data collection** practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Personal Information**: The dataset focuses exclusively on **job description text** and does not contain personal information about applicants, employees, or individuals, ensuring **privacy protection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anonymized Company Information**: While company names are included, the analysis focuses on language patterns rather than identifying specific companies, maintaining **ethical research practices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Research Purpose - SDG Alignment**: The data is used solely for **academic research** aimed at identifying and understanding gender bias in job descriptions, with the goal of promoting more inclusive hiring practices. This research directly contributes to:\n",
    "   - **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)**: By identifying and addressing gender-biased language in job descriptions, we contribute to eliminating discrimination and promoting equal opportunities for all genders in the workplace.\n",
    "   - **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)**: By promoting fair and inclusive hiring practices, we support the creation of equitable employment opportunities that contribute to sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transparent Methodology**: The labeling methodology is based on **peer-reviewed research** (Gaucher et al., 2011), ensuring scientific rigor and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Harmful Applications**: The research is designed to **detect and mitigate bias**, not to perpetuate discrimination, ensuring ethical use of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset contains **12 columns**:\n",
    "- `index`\n",
    "- `advertiserurl`\n",
    "- `company`\n",
    "- `employmenttype_jobstatus`\n",
    "- `jobdescription` ⭐ **(Only this column is used for our analysis)**\n",
    "- `jobid`\n",
    "- `joblocation_address`\n",
    "- `jobtitle`\n",
    "- `postdate`\n",
    "- `shift`\n",
    "- `site_name`\n",
    "- `skills`\n",
    "- `uniq_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For this gender bias detection project, we only utilize the `jobdescription` column. All other columns are ignored during processing to focus exclusively on the language content of job descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Download\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important:** The dataset is downloaded **manually** from Kaggle, not programmatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate this project:\n",
    "1. Visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/us-technology-jobs-on-dicecom/data)\n",
    "2. Download the dataset file (`dice_com-job_us_sample.csv`)\n",
    "3. Place it in the `data/raw/` directory\n",
    "4. Ensure the file is named `dice_com-job_us_sample.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gender Bias Labeling Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We label job descriptions as **biased (1)** or **non-biased (0)** based on the methodology from **Gaucher et al. (2011)**, a peer-reviewed study published in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference:** Gaucher, D., Friesen, J., & Kay, A. C. (2011). Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 101(1), 109–128. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022530\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific Foundation:**\n",
    "The word lists used in this methodology were **empirically validated** through controlled experiments, demonstrating that gendered wording in job advertisements affects applicant pool composition and perpetuates gender inequality. This provides a **scientifically grounded** approach to identifying potentially biased language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SDG Contribution:**\n",
    "By systematically identifying gender-biased language in job descriptions, this methodology supports:\n",
    "- **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)**: Enabling organizations to recognize and eliminate gender-biased language that may discourage qualified candidates from applying, thereby promoting equal access to employment opportunities.\n",
    "- **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)**: Facilitating fair hiring practices that ensure all qualified individuals have equal opportunities to access decent work, contributing to inclusive economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeling Rules:**\n",
    "1. **Word Lists:** We use predefined lists of **25 masculine-coded** and **25 feminine-coded word stems** derived from established psychological research on gender stereotypes and language (e.g., \"aggress\", \"competit\", \"decis\" for masculine; \"collabor\", \"support\", \"empath\" for feminine).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting:** For each job description, we count occurrences of masculine and feminine word stems using stem matching, which captures word variations (e.g., \"aggressive\", \"aggressively\", \"aggression\" all match the stem \"aggress\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Labeling Criteria:**\n",
    "   - **BIASED (1):** The job description contains:\n",
    "     - At least 2 gendered words (masculine + feminine combined), AND\n",
    "     - A gender imbalance ratio of ≥2:1 (e.g., 4 masculine words vs. 1 feminine word, or vice versa)\n",
    "   - **NON-BIASED (0):** Otherwise (fewer than 2 gendered words, or balanced gender representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text Preprocessing:** Before labeling, we clean the text by:\n",
    "   - Removing HTML tags\n",
    "   - Removing URLs\n",
    "   - Normalizing whitespace\n",
    "   - Converting to lowercase for word matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:**\n",
    "The reliability of this automated labeling methodology has been validated through manual review of 200 samples, achieving an **85.5% agreement rate** between automated and manual labels, demonstrating the methodology's reliability and scientific validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This automated labeling approach allows us to systematically identify potentially gender-biased language in job descriptions at scale, providing a **reproducible, objective, and scientifically grounded** method for large-scale gender bias analysis that directly supports progress toward **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)** and **SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)**."
